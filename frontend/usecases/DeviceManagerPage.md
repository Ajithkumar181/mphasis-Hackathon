## ⚙️ **Frontend Use Case: Device Manager Page**

### 📄 **Page Name:** `DeviceManagerPage.js`

### 🎯 **Purpose:**

To **monitor and manage connected devices (peers)** in real-time during file transfer.
This page ensures **stable connections**, detects **network issues**, and allows the user to **reconnect or disconnect** devices manually.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔗 **Connected Devices List**      | Displays all currently connected peers with details like device name, ID, and connection status. | User can easily see who is online and connected.                 |
| 📶 **Network Strength Monitor**    | Shows live signal strength, latency, and packet loss updates.                                    | Helps user detect weak connections before transfer interruption. |
| ♻️ **Reconnect Button**            | Allows re-establishing connection with any disconnected device.                                  | Ensures minimal downtime during transfer.                        |
| ❌ **Disconnect Option**            | Enables user to manually disconnect a peer.                                                      | User gains full control over active connections.                 |
| ⚡ **Ping Test (Latency Check)**    | Sends a test signal to check real-time latency in ms.                                            | Measures responsiveness and speed between peers.                 |
| 🔔 **Live Socket Updates**         | Uses Socket.io events to automatically update UI when devices connect/disconnect.                | Real-time synchronization — no manual refresh required.          |
| 🧠 **Connection Status Indicator** | Displays overall system network status (e.g., Connected / Unstable / Disconnected).              | Quick overview of network health.                                |

## 🖥️ **Frontend Flow (Step-by-Step)**

| **Step** | **User Action / Event**            | **Frontend Behavior**                   | **Socket / API Communication**                            |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣      | User opens **Device Manager Page** | Initializes connection to socket server | `io("http://localhost:5000")`                             |
| 2️⃣      | Component loads                    | Requests list of connected devices      | `socket.emit("getConnectedDevices")`                      |
| 3️⃣      | Server sends device list           | Renders all peers dynamically on UI     | `socket.on("devices-list", data)`                         |
| 4️⃣      | A new device connects              | Adds it to the list automatically       | `socket.on("device-connected")`                           |
| 5️⃣      | A device disconnects               | Removes it from the active list         | `socket.on("device-disconnected")`                        |
| 6️⃣      | User clicks **Ping**               | Measures latency, displays in popup     | `socket.emit("ping-device")` + `socket.on("pong-device")` |
| 7️⃣      | User clicks **Reconnect**          | Attempts to restore connection          | `socket.emit("reconnect-device")`                         |
| 8️⃣      | User clicks **Disconnect**         | Removes peer manually                   | `socket.emit("disconnect-device")`                        |
| 9️⃣      | Network fluctuates                 | Updates overall connection health       | `socket.on("network-health")`                             |

## 🔄 **Data Flow Summary**

| **Action**            | **Frontend Library Used**  | **Data Source / Destination** |
| --------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Fetch device list     | Socket.io-client           | Backend socket server         |
| Update connection     | React useState / useEffect | Real-time events              |
| Manage UI             | Tailwind + ShadCN UI       | Local component state         |

## 🧠 **Example Frontend Scenario**

**Scenario:**
Ajith (Sender) is transferring files to two receivers in different locations. Suddenly, one receiver’s connection drops.

**Frontend Flow:**

1. DeviceManagerPage automatically shows:

   * Receiver 1 → ✅ Connected
   * Receiver 2 → ❌ Disconnected
2. Ajith clicks **Reconnect** → system reinitializes connection.
3. A popup shows **“Receiver 2 reconnected successfully.”**
4. Ajith runs a **Ping Test** → sees latency: *82 ms*.
5. The dashboard updates automatically and resumes the file transfer.

## ✅ **Outcome**

By implementing the **Device Manager Page**, users gain:

* **Real-time control** over all connected devices
* **Instant feedback** on connection issues
* **Improved transfer reliability** through reconnection and ping tests

Would you like me to give the **UML Use Case Diagram (visual)** for this page — showing **Actor → DeviceManagerPage → System Events** (like reconnect, ping, disconnect)?
I can generate it as a **.png** ready for your report or PowerPoint.
