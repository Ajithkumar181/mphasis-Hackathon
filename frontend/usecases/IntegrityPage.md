## ⚙️ Frontend Use Case: Integrity Page

📄 **Page Name:** `IntegrityPage.jsx`

### 🎯 Purpose

To **verify the integrity of transferred files** by checking hash values (like SHA256 or MD5) and displaying transfer logs. This ensures that files are received correctly and are not corrupted during transfer.

### 🖥️ Frontend Flow (Step-by-Step)

| Step | User Action / Event   | Frontend Behavior                                 |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣  | Open Integrity Page   | Component loads file list from mock data or API   |
| 2️⃣  | Select a file         | UI highlights file and shows verification options |
| 3️⃣  | Click “Verify”        | Compute or compare hash locally (simulated)       |
| 4️⃣  | Verification complete | Display result: Verified ✅ / Corrupted ❌          |
| 5️⃣  | View logs             | User sees timestamp, transfer ID, retries, errors |

### 🔄 Data Flow Summary

| Action          | Frontend Library Used        | Data Source / Destination |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Fetch file list | useState / useEffect         | Mock data or REST API     |
| Verify file     | JS hash function (simulated) | Local state               |
| Update status   | React state                  | Component re-render       |
| Show logs       | Tailwind Table               | Local state or mock logs  |

### 🧠 Example Frontend Scenario

**Scenario:** Ajith has transferred 3 files to a colleague. He wants to ensure all files arrived correctly.

**Frontend Flow:**

1. Integrity Page loads → shows 3 files:

   * File 1 → Pending
   * File 2 → Pending
   * File 3 → Pending

2. Ajith clicks **Verify** on File 1 → popup shows: “File Verified ✅”.

3. File 1 status updates to **Verified**, color changes to green.

4. File 2 fails hash check → status shows **Corrupted ❌**, option to **Re-verify**.

5. Logs table records all verification attempts with timestamp and retry count.

Outcome: Ajith can immediately identify corrupted files and ensure transfer reliability.

### 🧩 Frontend Tech Stack Used

| Technology                        | Purpose                           |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| React.js (Functional Components)  | UI building and state management  |
| Tailwind CSS / ShadCN UI          | Clean, responsive styling         |
| React Hooks (useEffect, useState) | Dynamic updates and re-rendering  |
| Optional Axios                    | Fetch logs from backend if needed |

---

✅ **Outcome**

* Users can verify files instantly without backend dependency (demo mode).
* Logs provide a historical record for troubleshooting.
* UI is intuitive and professional for a dashboard.

If you want, I can also **write the full React + Tailwind demo code for `IntegrityPage.jsx`** with **file list, hash simulation, verification status, and logs table**, ready to plug into your `App.js`.

Do you want me to do that?
