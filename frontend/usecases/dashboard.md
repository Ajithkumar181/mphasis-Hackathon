Absolutely! Let‚Äôs focus specifically on the **Dashboard use case** for your **Smart File Transfer System**, written in a **step-by-step, exam-ready** style. This will highlight **frontend behavior, features, and user interactions**.

# üñ•Ô∏è Dashboard Use Case ‚Äì Smart File Transfer System

## **Use Case Name:** Real-Time File Transfer Management Dashboard

**Purpose:**
The Dashboard serves as the **central hub** for managing all file transfers, monitoring progress, and viewing transfer history.

---

## **Actors:**

* **Sender (Ajith)** ‚Äì uploads files to peers
* **Receiver** ‚Äì receives files
* **System** ‚Äì handles chunked transfers, progress updates, and logs

---

## **Preconditions:**

* User is **authenticated** (logged in)
* Peer-to-peer connection is **established** via room code

---

## **Trigger:**

User opens the Dashboard page after connecting peers.

---

## **Main Flow (Step-by-Step):**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload a File**

**Action:** Sender drags & drops a file or clicks ‚ÄúSelect File‚Äù.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* File appears in **Upload Panel** with:

  * Name
  * Size
  * Priority dropdown (High / Normal / Low)
* User clicks **Start Transfer**
* File is split into **chunks** (1MB or configurable)
* Each chunk is emitted via `socket.emit("file-chunk")`

**Demo Tip:** Use a large file (e.g., 50MB) to show chunked transfer visually.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Monitor Active Transfers**

**Action:** File transfer starts.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* Active Transfers list shows:

  * File name
  * Size
  * Progress bar (%)
  * Speed
  * Pause / Resume / Cancel buttons
* `socket.on("progress-update")` updates the UI **live**

**Demo Tip:** Pause and resume a transfer to demonstrate interactive controls.

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Transfer History**

**Action:** File completes or fails.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* Moves to **Transfer History** table with:

  * File name
  * Size
  * Status (Completed / Failed / Pending)
  * Timestamp
* Allows filtering and sorting by status or date

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Error Handling**

**Action:** Simulate network drop or receiver disconnect.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* Transfer pauses automatically
* Retry count displayed
* User can **resume** or **cancel**

**Demo Tip:** Shows system reliability and error recovery.

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ File Integrity Verification**

**Action:** Click **Verify File** after transfer.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* Frontend calls `GET /api/verify/:fileId`
* Hash check (SHA256/MD5) is displayed
* Status updated: **Verified ‚úÖ** or **Corrupted ‚ùå**

**Demo Tip:** Highlight verification for sensitive files (e.g., lab reports).

---

### **6Ô∏è‚É£ Settings Integration (Optional)**

**Action:** Adjust chunk size, bandwidth limit, or auto-retry.
**Frontend Behavior:**

* New transfers use updated settings
* Progress and transfer speed are affected immediately

---

## **Frontend Events Summary**

| Feature                 | Frontend Action            | Backend/Socket Event                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Upload File             | Drag/drop or select        | `socket.emit("file-chunk")`              |
| Monitor Progress        | Display % completed, speed | `socket.on("progress-update")`           |
| Pause / Resume / Cancel | User clicks button         | `socket.emit("pause"/"resume"/"cancel")` |
| Verify File             | Click verify               | `GET /api/verify/:fileId`                |
| Transfer History        | Auto-update table          | REST API / local state                   |

## **Real-World Demo Scenario**

**Scenario:**

1. Ajith uploads three medical scan files to HQ.
2. Dashboard shows live progress bars and speed.
3. One file encounters a temporary network drop ‚Üí auto-retry triggers.
4. All files complete successfully ‚Üí integrity verified.
5. Logs show timestamps, retry counts, and statuses.

‚úÖ Demonstrates **real-time updates, user control, reliability, and verification**.

---

If you want, I can also create a **React + Tailwind functional Dashboard demo code** implementing **Upload Panel, Active Transfers, Progress Bars, and File Verification**, fully interactive for Ajith‚Äôs exam/demo.

Do you want me to do that next?
